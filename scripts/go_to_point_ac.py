   :synopsis: this file is an implementation of go to point action server node
   
.. moduleauthor:: Carmine Recchiuto - Yara Abdelmottaleb
 
This node implements the go to point action server node. 
When an action request is received with a goal position, it drives the robot towards the goal.
It drives the robot in three steps:
- rotating the robot around its z-axis until it is oriented towards the goal point
- going straight ahead until it reaches the goal point
- rotating the robot around its z-axis until it is oriented in the goal orientation
During the three steps, if a cancel request is received through the action server, 
the goal is aborted and the robot stops.
